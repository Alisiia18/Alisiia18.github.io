	   <h1>Outer Care Routine</h1>
	   </header>
	   <p>People like to get compliments and be attractive and sometimes we need to work for the desirable results. I do not imply any surgeries, I think that healthy glowing skin, strong hair and nails are the indicators of health and that is enough to be attractive. Yes, I am inclined to natural beauty. I believe that outer care consists of making exercises, moisturizing your skin and getting rid of any undesirable blemishes from your skin.
As I like everything natural, here are some videos about facial care and natural makeup videos that I like the most.<p>
