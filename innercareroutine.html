	   <h1>Inner Care Routine</h1>
	   </header>
	   <p style="text:bold;">All my adolescence I was trying to conceal undesirable flaws (mostly that was skin), but not curing it. Now I know that outer care is important, nevertheless, the inner care is of paramount importance. As I mentioned in the "Living Healthy" section that it is crucial what do we consume, we should not disregard all useful elements for our health. For example, if you are vegan and do not eat food related to animals, you should substitute mean proteins to nuts, beans and mushrooms. Do not forget about vitamins, calcium. If your skin has flaws such as pimples, blemishes, weir color, that is not only cosmetic problem, that is an indicator that something goes wrong in your organism and you need to cure it. Inner care does not only consists of what do we consume, it also includes our way of thinking. If you have thoughts-parasites, you should get rid of them, change the way of living so that every day of yours would be a blessing. 
When I was growing older, I had different thoughts of mine according my life. I understood that while I am young, I can change everything, however, that is even not the matter of age. If you are in a constant state of depression, anxiety or gloominess you need a change. 
Here I included some links to the videos that put me in in good spirits and help me to understand that I am not the only one who experiences rises and falls. It is easier to stand up and go on when you know that you are not alone.</p>
