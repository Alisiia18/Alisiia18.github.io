	<h1>Living Healthy</h1>
	<p>Have you ever thought what do you eat? There is even a commonly known saying: "You are what you eat". I have never considered food as something that I should thoroughly select before putting it into into my body, however, I have realized some vital aspects after the first year of my studies. Why only then? Probably because I have changed the country of living, but most important, the way of living.</p>
	<p>I had a long and in some kind, breath-taking story of my "environment" change, but now let's turn to eating topic. When I became a freshman, I've experienced drastic changes in all spheres of my life. Food is not an exception. There were times when I deified it or, vice versa, neglected its existence. One year later I realized that that was a huge mistake. Now, getting rid of all problems that I gained last year, such as dry split hair, problem skin and excessive kilos, I finally know how it is crucial to take care of own health.</p> 
<p>First of all, Your body is your temple. Even if it sounds absolutely crazy to you, take care of your body health. Do not think that you are still young, vigorous and full of life so that you may start caring about your health when you grow older. No. Now I know that your appearance in your old age depends on your way of living in teens and twentieth. Your future depends from your present, therefore you should make smart investments in yourself.</p>
<p>Now I have also realized that if you choose a big fat piece of cake persuading yourself that you are sad and oppressed by life, that is a sign of food-dependent person. Our perception of food is definitely distorted by media. We eat when we feel sad, lonely or happy, however, food was intended to serve us as a fuel for our organism not a trigger of our mood change. 
The key aspect of living healthy is love towards your organism. When you love yourself, you'll take proper care of yourself. That is simple. Do not deify food, however, it does not mean that you should eat something insipid or disgusting. Just learn your organism and figure out what is the most healthy for you. </p>

<p1>Here are some healthy and tasty recipes. Enjoy!</p1>
